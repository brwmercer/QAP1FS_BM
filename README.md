This is my first QAP for Fullstack JavaScript in semester 3 of Software Development at Keyin College
This is a CLI application that uses Node.js to be able to automatically generate random passwords.
The password defaults at a length of 8 and only includes lower case letters.
If you wish you can also add upper case letters, symbols and numbers and change the desired length.
This CLI application also includes a help message to help users navigate the application and discover all arguments.
